## Ideas to implement (just for leaarning)
- Distribute as 
  - Python package
  - Go binary
- GitHub stats
- Twitter stats
- Check if all the needed tools for X are installed (bonus: and up to date)
- Automatic local set up (e.g. instal Docker, etc)
- Automatic set up for a project (clone repo, install tools, run all the tests, etc)
- Include help
- Self update
- Report new version exists
- Use Yubikey for retrieving secrets
