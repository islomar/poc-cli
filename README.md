## Ideas to implement (just for leaarning)
- Distribute as 
  - Python package
    - https://realpython.com/pypi-publish-python-package/
    - https://acloudguru.com/hands-on-labs/building-a-command-line-tool-with-python
  - Go binary
- Automate the publication with GitHub Actions
- GitHub stats
- Twitter stats
- Check if all the needed tools for X are installed (bonus: and up to date)
- Automatic local set up (e.g. instal Docker, etc)
- Automatic set up for a project (clone repo, install tools, run all the tests, etc)
- Include help
- Self update
- Report new version exists
- Use Yubikey for retrieving secrets
